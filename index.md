Within our community, we engage in conversations concerning the security and vulnerabilities associated with web applications, APIs, mobile platforms, and various other devices. We actively exchange knowledge, tools, and techniques focused on enhancing web application security. The primary purpose of establishing this community is to foster unity among cybersecurity experts. Our shared objective is to collaboratively work towards the security of web applications.
